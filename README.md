# AnimeReferenceProblemSet
A set of original competitive coding problems from various topics with one thing in common - each of them needs to contain an Anime reference. Do not ask why....

### Rules
1. __Every problem must have an anime storyline__.
2. The storyline must be prominent and contain references from the plot of the anime.
3. __No spoilers allowed__ for any anime.
4. Problems should be of competetive programming type and difficulty should be __at most INOI level__.
5. The general competetive coding format should be followed in the problems.

### Contributing Guidelines

1. Each problem must be a folder inside the 'problems' folder. 
2. The problem folder must contain 3 text files - problem statement, input and output.
3. The problem statement must explain the problems clearly. Input and Output formats, as well as the constraints must be included.
4. The input and output should be text files with the input testcases and subsequent outputs. This should be in accordance to the input and output formats specified in your problem.
5. __Most importantly, do not forget the AnImE ReFeReNcE XD__

__PRs for adding new problems, or modifying existing ones are always Welcome!__
