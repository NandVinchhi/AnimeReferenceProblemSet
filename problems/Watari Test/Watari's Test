After detective L's humiliating defeat against his rival detective Light in the tennis match, he must redeem himself by winning round 2. 
Watari, his assistant has designed a fair test to decide the winner of the second round. Since the first round tested the physical ability 
of the contestants, Watari believes it only fair to test the mental abilities in the second round. Besides, exercising their brains will 
likely help them to catch the criminal faster. 

The test is as follows. Both contestants are given an integer n. Now n can be written as the product of some, not necessarly distinct 
primes. Say n = p_1*p_2*...*p_(r-1)*p_r. Now, let q_i be the i'th prime. For example q_1 = 2, q_2 = 3, q_3 = 5, etc. Their task is to find
the number of digits in the product q_(r-1) * q_r.
Whoever gets the answer first wins. Help L prove that he is clearly superior to Light when it comes to thinking.

INPUT
The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. On each line is a number n.

OUTPUT
Output the number of digits of q_(r-1)*q_r
If r = 1, then just output 0
