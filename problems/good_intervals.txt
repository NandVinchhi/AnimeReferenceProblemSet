Okabe is given a set S of N integers. let the (i + 1)th element in S be denoted by Si, starting from S0. 
Okabe needs to perform the following operation on S until it is reduced to a single integer:
let S' = {(S0 - S1), (S1 - S2), (S2 - S3) ..... (S(N-2) - S(N - 1))}
S = S'.

notice that after every iteration, the number of elements in S reduce by 1.
let the single integer value that you obtain after (N - 1) iterations be X.

since Okabe is busy at the moment, your task is to write a program to calculate the value of X, given S and N.

for example, if N = 3 and S = {5, 7, 2}
first iteration: 
S' = {(5 - 7), (7 - 2)} = {-2, 5}
S = S'

second iteration:
S' = {-2 - 5} = {-7}
S = S'

therefore, X = -7.

INPUT FORMAT:
-> The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow
-> For each test case, the first line contains a single integer N - the number of elements in the set.
-> The second line of each test case contains N spaced integers, which represent the set S.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
-> For each test case, print a single line containing the integer X.
