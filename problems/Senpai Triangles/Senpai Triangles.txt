You are given an N-lattice on the cartesian plane, which is a uniform square of n^2 dots. 
For example, a 3-lattice would look like this:

. . .
. . .
. . .

labelled version:
1. 2. 3. 
4. 5. 6.
7. 8. 9.

let us define a Senpai triangle as a triangle formed by any 3 points in this lattice, such that:
a) it is right angled.
b) the base is parellel to the x-axis.
c) the altitude is parallel to the y-axis.

For example (in the above labelled 3-lattice), triangles (1, 7, 8) and (3, 6, 5), right angled at 7 and 6 respectively,
are considered as Senpai.
Whereas, triangles (2, 6, 8) and (2, 7, 6) are not..... and will live in shame.

let us define the Senpai-ness of a N-lattice as the sum of areas of all its Senpai triangles (where 1 unit is taken as the distance
between any 2 horizontally or vertically adjacent dots). Given an integer N, your task is to find the Senpai-ness of the N-lattice.

For example, in the below 2-lattice, the possible senpai triangles are: (1, 3, 4), (2, 4, 3), (3, 1, 2) and (4, 2, 1). 
1. 2.
3. 4.
The sum of their areas (Senpai-ness) = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2.
