Genos is undergoing intense training from his master Saitama. The final, and most important lesson that Saitama wants to teach Genos is 
how to live in this harsh society. His task is to be as greedy as possible, so that he will learn how to cope with the most deadly monsters
which are the shopkeepers. Minimizing costs and bargaining are the two most important skills a man can have, however, Genos lacks these 
crucial skills, and so to teach him the proper way to reduce costs at the supermarket, Saitama has designed a test for him.

He has given Genos a (shopping) list containing some prices a_1, a_2, a_3, ... , a_n which happen to be the prices of the items on sale 
at the supermarket today. Genos may use the following bargain tactic: He may choose any two prices in the list a_i, a_j and replace the 
larger of the two with |a_i - a_j| and must also delete the smaller of the two.

Observe that after each bargain, the number of prices reduces by 1. So, after n-1 bargains, there will be only one price left. This is the 
final cost of all the items. Help Genos to find the minimum possible value of the final price so that Saitama's salary is safe.

INPUT
The input contains two lines; the first line is n, the number of prices in the shopping list and the second line will be numbers seperated
by an apostrophe followed by a blank space.

OUTPUT
Your output should only contain one number, which is the minimum possible value of the final price

SAMPLE INPUT
4
1, 3, 7, 9

SAMPLE OUTPUT
0

EXPLANATION
Clearly the final cost can never be negative. 0 is acheivable in the following way:
-> choose 9 and 7. Replace 9 with |7 - 9| = 2. 7 must be removed. Now the list is 1, 3, 2.
-> choose 3 and 2. Replace 3 with |3 - 2| = 1. 2 must be removed. Now the list is 1, 1.
-> choose 1 and 1. Replace 1 with |1 - 1| = 0. 1 must be removed. Now the list is 0.
