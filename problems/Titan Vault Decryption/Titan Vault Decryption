Captain Levi and the Scout Regiment have come upon a secret vault of ancient knowledge. Access to the manuscripts within would give 
them vital information about the titans. You and you team have been put to the task of cracking this vault. You are given a positive
integer N. After examining the mechanism of the vault, you have found that the password to crack it is the number of palindromes <= N. 
A palindrome is defined as a positive integer that reads the same way forwards and backwards. For example: 101, 5, 1221, 585 etc.

You task is to find the number of palindromes <= N. Note that all single digit positive integers are also considered palindromes.
For example, if N = 101, the palindromes <= N are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101.
therefore, your answer is 19. 

Time is running out and the lives of many depend on you and your team! Will the scout regiment succeed, or will the titans prevail....
