A disaster has occured. Schneizel el Britannia has captured the defence systems of the
Britannian empire and now has access to all the deadly weapons owned by the empire, including
the fabled F.L.E.I.J.A. Lelouch vi Britannia, despite having faked his death and sworn to
live the rest of his life in complete secrecy, cannot simply bear to witness all his lifes 
efforts and sacrifices go to waste, so he decides to put an end to Schneizel's misdeeds.

The defence systems have several passwords, and with the help of his genius ally Lloyd, 
Lelouch has been able to decipher the passwords, which each contains multiple words seperated 
by spaces (" "). However, there is a problem. Schneizel saw through your tactics and changed 
the passwords such that all the vowels in each word of the original password was moved to 
the beginning of each word in the opposite order that they appear in the word.
Your task is to help Lelouch retreive the defence systems and save Britannia once again.
